## Is this project live?

Yes. Visit https://rpmiller4.azurewebsites.net/

## What is it?

This project was originally going to be a professional portfolio. For now instead, I'm jamming as much machine learning into it as possible, beginning with the tensorflow QnA model.

## Why does the questions and answers submission form take so long on mobile?

That's because the tensorflow model has been converted to javascript and is running on your mobile phone.
